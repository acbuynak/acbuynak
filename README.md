### Hello! My name is A.C. Buynak

I am a robotics enthusiast and open-source developer. I enjoy working on robotic integration projects which impact the manufacturing and industrial workspaces.

I currently work in the [Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (AIMS) Lab](https://cdme.osu.edu/aims-lab) at The Ohio State University. My work includes software integration design, ROS education, and motion planning research. I serve as our organizations subject matter expert on ROS.

Currently, I'm researching multi-profile trajectory design through leveraging tools available in ROS.
